# Business Analytics in Healthcare Operation

## Overview

This project analyzes outpatient healthcare data to identify **cost drivers, patient experience patterns, pharmacy demand, and healthcare access**. The analysis integrates operational, financial, sentiment, and geospatial data to support decision-making in healthcare operations and policy contexts. I followed this project through a Linkedin course on Healthcare Analytics. 

## Data Sources
- Outpatient visit data (demographics, visit duration, costs, insurance status)
- Pharmacy sales data (medication name, class, quantity, price)
- Patient experience data (ratings, wait times, text reviews)
- Healthcare facility geolocation data (facility type, latitude, longitude)
## All sources and data files can found through the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18K4xiXxOUzPCJruUYZc5J8h7nfKrc5XT/view?usp=sharing.
